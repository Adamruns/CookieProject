# CookieProject
A beginner project that I worked on where I built a recipes web app.
Essentially what this does is it allows you to Create, Read, Update, or Delete a list of
recipes from a web sever. I hosted this project for free on Heroku and it can be
found below

## Notes
Any recipe submitted on the site will automatically be deleted after a certain
amount of time becuase the server is not hosted 24/7
